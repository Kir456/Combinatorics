# Combinatorics
Here you will see different programs according to this topic. These programs will help you to automate the process of solving Combinatorics problems. Right now I have one program in combinations:
1) Making combinations(with chosen length and numbers in them) where all combinations are sorted in ascending order and each number in them is unique(numbers in lines are also in ascending order)
2) Making combinations(with chosen length and numbers in them) where all combinations are sorted in ascending order and each number in them is unique(there is less restrictions)
